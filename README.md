### Project #5
Timeline: 2024.2.3 - 2024.2.22

This is a small project to visualize search algorithms, such as:
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Uniform-cost search (UCS)
- Greedy best-first search (GBeFS)
- A* search
- Weightedd A* search

During this project, I learned basic search algorithms and familiarized myself better with standard algorithms and containers.

Just noticed that there's an issue with paths that allow diagonal moves. I decided not to fix this to preserve the original state for future comparison.

### Controls
- Mouse Left: Draw walls
- Mouse Right: Place start/end cell
- G: Toggle grid
- A: Change algorithm
- C: Clear canvas
- D: Toggle diagonal actions
- I: Instant search
- R: Restart search
- Arrow Up: Increase search speed
- Arrow Up + Shift: Increase weight
- Arrow Down: Decrease search speed
- Arrow Down + Shift: Decrease weight
- Escape: Quit
